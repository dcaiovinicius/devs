 * Consider organizing styles into separate files for maintainability.

  The default border color has changed to `currentcolor` in Tailwind CSS v4,

  looks the same as it did with Tailwind CSS v3.

  If we ever want to remove these styles, we need to add an explicit border
  color utility to any element that depends on these defaults.
